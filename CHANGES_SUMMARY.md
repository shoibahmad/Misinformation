# CyberGuard AI - Changes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Failed to load search history" Error
**Problem**: The JavaScript was trying to fetch from `/history` endpoints that didn't exist in the backend.

**Solution**: 
- Added missing history API endpoints in `main.py`:
  - `GET /history` - Get search history with filters
  - `GET /history/{search_id}` - Get specific search details
  - `POST /history/{search_id}/favorite` - Toggle favorite status
  - `DELETE /history/{search_id}` - Delete search
  - `GET /history/statistics` - Get history statistics
  - `POST /history/clear` - Clear all history
- Integrated database functionality to save analysis results to history
- Added proper error handling and response formatting

### 2. NewsAPI Status Showing Red Despite Being Configured
**Problem**: JavaScript was looking for `newsapi_available` but Python was returning `newsdata_available`.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the key mismatch in `static/script.js`:
  ```javascript
  // Changed from:
  'newsapi-status': { name: 'NewsAPI', key: 'newsapi_available' }
  // To:
  'newsapi-status': { name: 'NewsAPI', key: 'newsdata_available' }
  ```

### 3. Header Design Improvements
**Problem**: Header layout was not optimal and history button placement could be improved.

**Solution**:
- Redesigned header layout in `static/index.html`:
  - Moved history button to the right side with other action buttons
  - Created three-section header: left (logo), center (subtitle), right (actions)
  - Made history button icon-only for cleaner appearance
- Updated CSS in `static/style.css`:
  - Added responsive header layout with flexbox
  - Improved button styling with hover effects
  - Added sticky header positioning
  - Enhanced mobile responsiveness

### 4. Missing Keyboard Shortcuts Functionality
**Problem**: JavaScript referenced `initializeKeyboardShortcuts()` but the function didn't exist.

**Solution**:
- Added complete keyboard shortcuts functionality:
  - `Escape` - Close modals and drawers
  - `1`, `2`, `3` - Switch between analysis tabs
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + H` - Toggle history drawer
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + E` - Export results
