# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Text Analysis application currently has a News Source Verification feature that is displaying an ERROR status and showing 0 values for all metrics (Related Articles Found: 0, Reliable News Sources: 0, Source Reliability Score: 0.0%). This feature is critical for validating the credibility of news content and needs to be fixed to provide accurate verification results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user analyzing text content, I want the News Source Verification feature to work correctly, so that I can assess the reliability and credibility of news sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits text for analysis THEN the system SHALL successfully query news APIs to find related articles
2. WHEN related articles are found THEN the system SHALL display the correct count of articles found
3. WHEN reliable news sources are identified THEN the system SHALL display the correct count of reliable sources
4. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL calculate and display an accurate source reliability score as a percentage
5. IF no related articles are found THEN the system SHALL display "0" for articles but not show an ERROR status
6. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages instead of generic ERROR status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see detailed information about the news verification process, so that I can understand how the reliability assessment was made.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the news verification completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display the verification status as "SUCCESS" or "VERIFIED"
2. WHEN articles are found THEN the system SHALL show a list of related articles with their sources
3. WHEN reliable sources are identified THEN the system SHALL highlight which sources are considered reliable
4. WHEN the reliability score is calculated THEN the system SHALL show the calculation methodology
5. IF the verification fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages explaining what went wrong

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the news verification to handle different types of content appropriately, so that I get relevant verification results regardless of the text type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing news-related content THEN the system SHALL extract relevant keywords for news API queries
2. WHEN analyzing non-news content THEN the system SHALL still attempt verification but indicate limited relevance
3. WHEN the text is too short or generic THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback about verification limitations
4. WHEN multiple relevant topics are found THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most relevant for verification
5. WHEN no relevant keywords can be extracted THEN the system SHALL explain why verification cannot be performed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the news verification feature to be resilient to API failures, so that temporary issues don't prevent me from getting analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GNews API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative verification methods
2. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL display appropriate rate limit messages
3. WHEN API keys are invalid THEN the system SHALL display configuration error messages
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry the request with exponential backoff
5. IF all verification methods fail THEN the system SHALL still provide other analysis results without blocking the entire analysis
